        <p>Oh God, where do I begin? </p>

        <p>Bonus points: I'm glad you added Saint Seiya (+1). Nice touch on the shopping cart. (+1) You used mysql even though it was not required. (+1)</p>

        <p>Visual appeal: Absolutely stunning visuals. But the JS animation you used caused a bug in ipad view. Please see my review video for details. (-1)</p>
		
		<p>Functional: Shopping cart links are broken all over the place. (-1) It was a hard site to navigate overall. (-1) Consider using a sitemap that lists all the pages. Another idea is to use a drop down menu, so that all pages can be accessed from the menu.</p>

        <p>Code Clarity: You could have used routing (like I showed in class several times) instead of an html page for each page (-1). Your file structure has a lot of redundancies, there are many opporunities to use php include or functions to reduce the code. Some files use capital letters, some do not, it's not consistent. </p>
    
        <p>Usefulness: It's not a good idea to put up that trippy video on a shopping cart, it gives me a seizure and would discourage users from buying anything. (-1) Consider showing that seizure video on another page.</p>
